                <p>
                    My name is Dylan Crotty, I am a student in the College of Engineering studying Computer Science at UVA.
                    I am in the class of 2024, and this webpage is an introduction to my background. I am currently a third year, and I am 
                    also in the CourseForum website club, along with the Chinese student Association. My hobbies are playing video games, going to
                    the gym, and hanging out with friends. Here you can find pages for my clubs, contact information, hobbies, and courses taken.
